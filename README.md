# Channels Chatbot

## Production Setup

To run the completed Chatbot on a live server, follow these steps,

1. Click the **Deploy to Heroku** Button,

   [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Fill in your [**Production** Zoom Chatbot API credentials](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/app-types/create-chatbot-app#register).

3. Click **Deploy app**.

4. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, add your Heroku url (https://yourherokuurl.com) to your Whitelist URLs (App Credentials Page), **Production** Redirect URL for OAuth (https://yourherokuurl.com/authorize) (App Credentials Page), and **Production** Bot Endpoint URL (https://yourherokuurl.com/webhook) (Features Page).

5. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, go to the **Submit** page and click **Add to Zoom**. After you click the **Authorize** button, you should be taken to your redirect url and see this,

   `Your Chatbot is now installed, open the Zoom App and type /slashcommand list in a channel or list in the Channels Chatbot!`

6. Now that your Chatbot is installed on your Zoom account, go to a Zoom Chat channel and type,

   `/slashcommand list`

   This will display a list of Channels the user who typed the slash command has access to. Click on a channel in the list to see the JID of that channel.

   `/slashcommand details`

   This will display the Channel JID and Channel Name of the Channel the command was typed in, as well as the Account ID.
